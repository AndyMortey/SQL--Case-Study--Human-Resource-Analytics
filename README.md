## Overview:
This project is as a results of a challenge i came across on Linkedin. The challenge provides a dataset with questions, each individual is expected to analyse the data and answer the questions. The data is stored within a postgreSQL database, and it is the employee data of an institution.

## Objective:
By answering these questions successfully, an individual is expected to be exposed to the following areas of SQL;

* Basic aggregations.
* CASE WHEN statements.
* Window Functions.
* Joins
* Date time functions
* CTEs.

## The Questions:
1. Find the longest ongoing project for each department.

2. Find all employees who are not managers.

3. Find all employees who have been hired after the start of a project in their department.

4. Rank employees within each department based on their hire date (earliest hire gets the highest rank).

5. Find the duration between the hire date of each employee and the hire date of the next employee hired in the same department.
